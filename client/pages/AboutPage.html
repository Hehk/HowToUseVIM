    <h3>VIM is a rich text editor built off the old vi editor. It was developed in 1991 by Bob Ross.</h3>
    <h3>
      It allows the user to do everything they could in a normal editor without ever leaving their keyboard.
      VIM also allows the user to interact with their file using multiple modes like Normal Mode, Insert Mode, Replace Mode, and Ex Mode to name a few.
      VIM also allows for a lot of very powerful parsing and code traversal tools that when learned make editing files way easier and faster.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      In this introduction I will teach you the basics of entering a file, editting it and saving your changes, which can be daunting on its own without instructions.
      There are many more better writen tutorials that I will link to at the end if you want to learn more. :D
